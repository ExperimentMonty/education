Comics
======

The point of this comics folder is to have a collection of comics to be used as
daily class-starters.  Round-robin-esque style, each student will be given a
comic and a week or two to read it, research the CS/Math-y parts of it, then
start off the class that day with a short, two minute max presentation
explaining the comic.  This serves a couple of purposes:

1. It teaches the children public speaking and presentation skills, which is
super-essential and useful no matter what they do.
2. It's a way for them to learn using comics, which are fun.
3. It's a way for them to learn more about various CS topics which might cause
them to be more interested in a STEM career.
4. It's a good way to wake the kids up and get them ready for a lecture, lab,
etc.
