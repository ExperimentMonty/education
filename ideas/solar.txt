CORE CONCEPT

-Get students interested in solar energy, coding, and microelectronics by
installing solar panels on the school roof.

What we'll need:
-Solar panel and necessary wiring
-Battery bank if we're not allowed to plug solar panel into the grid
-Arduino/Raspberry Pi for monitoring
-Case for Arduino/Raspberry Pi to keep it out of the elements
-Approval of the school
-Some kind of device to track the (voltage? watts? power?) coming off of the solar panels
-The knowhow of all of these technologies to lead some school kids through this.
-Server to store tracking information of how much we're getting from the solar panels.
